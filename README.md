<!-- Software Components Section -->
<h4 align="left" id="software-components">Software Components üìÇ</h4>

- **`MainGUI.py`**: The intuitive graphical interface, allowing you to encrypt or decrypt files effortlessly.

- **`Secure_Data_Transfer.py`**: The workflow manager, guiding you through file selection, encryption, and destination directory.

- **`SymmetricEncryptAES.py`**: Handles symmetric encryption, perfect for secure group sharing using the AES algorithm.

- **`AsymmetricRSAEncrypt.py`**: Employs RSA encryption with public keys for individual sharing, ensuring data security.

- **`Decrypt.py`**: Facilitates file decryption, supporting both symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

<!-- Hardware Components Section -->
<h4 align="left" id="hardware-components">Hardware Components üß∞</h4>

- **_Raspberry Pi:_** The invisible guardian between your computer and an external hard drive, fortifying data security.

- **_External Hard Drive:_** A secure vault for your encrypted files, ensuring data remains protected, even if the drive is misplaced.

### Auto-Start

Connect the Raspberry Pi to your computer, and the `MainGUI.py` application will auto-launch, offering a seamless user experience.

### Encrypting Files

Secure your files for:

- **Group Sharing (Symmetric Encryption):** Select a file, pick the encryption method, and specify the destination directory on the connected hard drive.

- **Individual Sharing (Asymmetric Encryption):** Select a file, provide the recipient's public key, and choose the destination directory.

### Decrypting Files

To decrypt files:

- **Symmetric Encryption:** Enter the encryption key and choose the destination directory.

- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Pick your private key file and the destination directory.

<!-- Hardware Integration Section -->
<h2 align="center">Hardware Integration üîå</h2>

<p align="center">
  <em>Seamless, Yet Robust.</em>
</p>

1. Connect the external hard drive to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Power up the Raspberry Pi to recognize and auto-mount the hard drive upon connection.

3. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the computer handle file encryption, decryption, and data transfer to/from the hard drive.

<h2 align="center">Alternative Usage üìã</h2>

To use the Secure Data Transfer Software on another hardware, follow these steps:

1. Upgrade pip to the latest version:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
2. Install the Secure Data Transfer package:

   ```bash
   pip install secureDataTransfer
   ```
3. run the package.
   ```bash
   secure-data-transfer
   ```

<p align="center">
  <em>The Building Blocks.</em>
</p>

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The primary programming language used for scripting and development.

- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/): A Python binding for the Qt application framework, used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

- [Crypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/): A cryptographic library for Python, providing support for encryption and decryption operations.

- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/): The operating system for the Raspberry Pi, which serves as the core hardware component.

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed and configured correctly to run the Secure Data Transfer Device.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
