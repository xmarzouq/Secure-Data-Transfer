# Secure Data Transfer Device

## Project Description

The Secure Data Transfer Device is designed to provide users with a secure and user-friendly solution for encrypting, transferring, and decrypting data while maintaining data privacy and security. This project leverages the Raspberry Pi as a core hardware component to act as an invisible intermediary between the user's computer and an external hard drive. It ensures that data remains protected during storage and transfer, offering a robust solution for secure data management.
